# Put a list of field-value pairs here. All database searches will have
# these constraints added as additional AND clauses. If you don't want
# Solr to escape special Lucene characters, prefix the field name with a
# _. E.g.:
#   gkey "group A" AND "group B" appends: AND gkey:(\"group A\" and \"group B\")
# whereas :
#   _gkey "group A" AND "group B" appends: AND gkey:("group A" AND "group B")
