  The Student Voice is an initiative of the Canadian Association of Research
  Libraries (CARL). It is an online portal to growing historical collections of
  post-secondary student media drawn from the holdings of CARL member libraries
  and student organizations across the country.

<p>
  Search the portal to discover post-secondary student media from 1945 to 2000.
  This time period was selected for its richness in student expression, from the
  post-war enthusiasm and growth, to the increasing restlessness and activism
  that have shaped the education system and Canadian campuses.

  This digitization project serves to provide a centralized repository for this
  fragile material through Canadiana. Currently, the portal provides access to
  student newspapers of our pilot sites. Ultimately, we hope to encourage more
  institutions and Canadian student organizations to preserve digitally,
  aggregate and make accessible these hidden collections.

  The project has been made possible by funding provided by the Government of
  Canada through the Documentary Heritage Communities Program of Library and
  Archives Canada.
