<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>
  <strong><i>Canadian Parliamentary Historical Resources</i></strong> provides a
  centralized, streamlined means of accessing historical debates and journals of
  the Senate and House of Commons, in both official languages.
</p>

<p>
  The Senate and House of Commons Debates, commonly known as the <i>Debates</i>,
  or Hansard, contain the transcribed, edited and corrected record of full
  deliberations of both Houses of Parliament.
</p>

<p>
  Since the adoption of official reporting (in 1871 for the Senate and 1880 for
  the House of Commons), the daily editions of the Hansard were issued in bound,
  well-indexed volumes. From 1875 to 1879, for the House of Commons, a verbatim,
  condensed Hansard was compiled and printed by outside contractors. By 1880,
  the House of Commons favoured the adoption of a verbatim report compiled by
  employees of the House itself. This site has been produced from digitized
  editions of these volumes, all available under their corresponding Parliament
  and Session, in the Browse function of this portal.
</p>

<p>
  This portal includes reconstituted debates, which represent debates for the
  years prior to the adoption of official reporting. These reconstituted debates
  are an unofficial version of the debates, drawn from newspaper reports of the
  day. Finally, the portal also includes translated debates for the Senate of
  Canada, which began its official report in English only. All of the
  reconstituted and translated content can be identified in the records.
</p>

<p>
  The Senate and House of Commons Journals are the notes and records kept by the
  Clerks and other Table Officers during a sitting. They are the official record
  of Senate and House decisions and other transactions such as petitions
  presented, documents tabled, etc.
</p>

<p>
  The Journals were first published in 1867 and the daily editions were issued
  in bound, well-indexed volumes. This site has been produced from digitized
  editions of these volumes, all available under their corresponding Parliament
  and Session, in the Browse function of this portal.
</p>

<p>
  In 1994, the House began to distribute its publications electronically by
  making its publications accessible worldwide through the Parliament of Canada
  Web site. The Senate followed suit in 1996. To access debates and journals
  from these dates and later, please visit
  <a href="http://parl.gc.ca/" target="_blank">parl.gc.ca</a>, under
  Parliamentary Business.
</p>

<h4>Browsing and Searching</h4>

<p>
  The <strong>Browse function</strong> on the left-hand side of the home page
  allows the user to track down a specific volume in a given Parliament and
  Session. Once a volume is selected, it can be viewed and further searched.
</p>

<p>
  Also, the Browse function allows users to perform a
  <strong>Keyword search</strong> within a selected session, using the search
  box located in the top left side of the viewer. Those results can then be
  narrowed down using the different restrictions located to the left of the
  screen.
</p>

<p>
  The user will notice a difference between the Browse function for the debates
  and for the journals. The standardization of the Browse function is currently
  being developed.
</p>

<p>
  The simple <strong>Search form</strong> on the right-hand side of the home
  page allows for searching the full text content of the Portal. The user can
  choose to search either publication or search both simultaneously. For finer
  control, the user can narrow his search by Chamber, Parliament, Language and
  Date.
</p>

<p>The following features can be used to refine searches:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h5>Phrases: ""</h5>
    <p>
      To search for an exact phrase, enclose all of the words in double quotes.
      <em>You cannot use wildcards within a phrase.</em> For example, to find
      documents that contain the phrase "quebec city" and not just the
      individual terms "quebec" and "city":
      <code
        ><a href="http://parl.canadiana.ca/search?q=%22quebec+city%22"
          >"quebec city"</a
        ></code
      >
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>Wildcards: ? and *</h5>
    <p>
      Use ? in the middle or at the end of a word to match any one character.
      Use * to match any number of characters (including zero). For example, to
      find either "defence" or "defense":
      <code
        ><a href="http://parl.canadiana.ca/search?q=defen%3Fe">defen?e</a></code
      >
      To find either "labour" or "labor":
      <code><a href="http://parl.canadiana.ca/search?q=labo*r">labo*r</a></code>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>Excluded term: -</h5>
    <p>
      Use - in front of a word or phrase to indicate that the term must not
      appear in the record. For example, to find documents that contain "paris"
      but not "france":
      <code
        ><a href="http://parl.canadiana.ca/search?q=paris+-france"
          >paris -france</a
        ></code
      >
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>Alternate terms: |</h5>
    <p>
      To match any one of a number of alternative terms, put a | between them.
      For example, to find "ontario" and either "york" or "toronto":
      <code
        ><a href="http://parl.canadiana.ca/search?q=canada+york+%7C+toronto"
          >ontario york | toronto</a
        ></code
      >
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    &#9;
    <h5>Accents</h5>
    &#9;
    <p>
      Search terms are not case or accent-sensitive: "Fran&ccedil;ais" and
      "francais" will produce the same result.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Search results page</h4>

<p>
  By default, search results are presented in order of relevance. Users can
  change the sort order by &ldquo;newest&rdquo; or &ldquo;oldest&rdquo;.
</p>

<h4>Page viewer</h4>

<p>
  Use the functions of the page viewer to zoom in on the digitized page image,
  to select a specific page number, and to otherwise move through the volume.
  Right-click on the page image and use the &ldquo;Print picture&rdquo; function
  to print the page showing in the viewer.
</p>

<h4>Linking to your results</h4>

<p>
  Each volume has a permanent URL if you wish to bookmark it, or send the link
  to someone. This link can be found in the metadata, under the
  <strong>About</strong> tab at the top of the page viewer.
</p>

<p>
  Your search result list can also be shared by copying the link in the address
  bar from the results page.
</p>

<h4>Linking to a Single Page</h4>

<p>
  To link to a single page from the Debates or Journals, note the
  <strong>image number</strong> (not the publication&rsquo;s page number). Copy
  the permanent link on the <strong>About</strong> tab of the viewer for that
  particular page. Add a forward slash (/) and the image number.
</p>

<p>
  For example, page 3176 of volume 4, 1st session, 15th Parliament of the House
  of Commons is image number 38. Go to the <strong>About</strong> tab and copy
  the permanent link. Add a forward slash (/) and the image number:
  <a href="http://parl.canadiana.ca/view/oop.debates_HOC1501_04/38"
    >http://parl.canadiana.ca/view/oop.debates_HOC1501_04/38</a
  >
</p>

<p>This takes you directly to the image.</p>

<h4>Downloading Full Volumes</h4>

<p>
  To obtain a PDF copy of a particular publication, you must download the full
  volume. It is not possible at the moment to download single pages. Download
  times will vary due to the size of the file and to traffic. It may require
  several minutes to fully download.
