<h3>Browsing and Searching</h3>

<p>
  The collections in the database can be accessed using browse or search.
</p>

<h3>Browse</h3>

<p>
  The Browse function is on the left-hand side of the home page. The Browse
  function can be accessed from the menu in the top right corner. Browse allows
  you to locate a specific volume in a given parliament and session. Once a
  volume is selected, you can view it and search further within it.
</p>

<p>
  Once you have selected a volume, use the
  <b>Search within this volume:</b> search box located in the top left side of
  the viewer to search for keywords within the volume. A list of matching pages
  (listed as numbered images) that contain the search terms will appear below
  the search box. Click on each page in turn to view it (the list of matching
  pages for your search remains on the page while you view individual pages).
</p>

<h3>Search</h3>

<p>
  The Search function is on the right-hand side of the home page and allows for
  searching the full text content of the portal. By selecting or deselecting the
  various checkboxes or using the drop-down menus, you can search within
  specific types of publications, or narrow your search by chamber, parliament,
  language and date.
</p>

<p>
  You can access the home page with both the <b>Browse</b> and
  <b>Search</b> functions by selecting the <b>New Search</b> option in the menu
  in the top right corner.
</p>

<p>
  The search form is a simple tool that lets you search for descriptive
  information and metadata, such as titles, author/creator names, subject
  keywords, or the text content of books and other documents, where available.
  Search terms are not case or accent-sensitive: "Français" and "francais" will
  produce the same result.
</p>

<p>
  The following features can be used within the search box to refine the
  results:
</p>

<h4>Wildcards: ? and *</h4>

<p>
  Use <code>?</code> in the middle or at the end of a word to match any one
  character. Use <code>*</code> to match any number of characters (including
  zero).
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    For example, to find either <code>defence</code> or <code>defense</code>:
    <strong><a href="/search?q0.0=defen%3Fe">defen?e</a></strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    To find either <code>labour</code> or <code>labor</code>:
    <strong><a href="/search?q0.0=labo*r">labo*r</a></strong>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Phrases: ""</h4>

<p>
  To search for an exact phrase, enclose all of the words in double quotes. You
  cannot use wildcards within a phrase.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    For example, to find documents that contain the phrase
    <code>quebec city</code> and not just the individual terms
    <code>quebec</code> and <code>city</code>:
    <strong><a href='/search?q0.0="quebec+city"'>"quebec city"</a></strong>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Excluded terms: -</h4>

<p>
  Use <code>-</code> (a hyphen) in front of a word or phrase to indicate that
  the term must not appear in the record.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    For example, to find documents that contain <code>paris</code> but not
    <code>france</code>:
    <strong
      ><a href="/search/?q0.0=paris&amp;q1.0=-france">paris -france</a></strong
    >
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Alternate terms: |</h4>

<p>
  To match any one of a number of alternative terms, put a
  <code>|</code> between them.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    For example, to find "ontario" and either "york" or "toronto":
    <strong
      ><a href="/search/?q0.0=canada&amp;q1.0=york&amp;q1.1=toronto"
        >ontario york | toronto</a
      ></strong
    >
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Sort Research Results</h3>

<p>
  By default, search results are presented in order of relevance based on the
  search terms used. On your search results page, you can change the sort order
  to start with “newest” first or “oldest” first.
</p>

<h3>Page Viewer</h3>

<p>
  Once you have selected a volume, use the functions of the page viewer to
  select a specific image number, to scroll through the volume, to rotate an
  image left or right, and to zoom in on or out of the page image.
</p>

<h3>Share</h3>

<p>
  If you want to share your search results, on your search results page you can
  copy the entire link in the address bar of your browser into an email.
</p>

<p>
  Each volume also has its own permanent URL if you wish to bookmark it or share
  the link. You can find this link if you select the page viewer’s
  <b>About</b> tab, located to the right of the <b>View</b> tab.
</p>

<p>
  To create a permanent link to a specific page of a publication, copy the URL
  found in your browser up to (but not including) the “?”. Paste this shortened
  link into an email or other document. This creates a direct link to the page.
</p>

<h3>Download</h3>

<p>
  Full volumes of the debates, journals and sessional papers can be downloaded,
  while single pages from committee documentation, bills, Senate Minutes of
  Proceedings, the Rules of the Senate, the House of Commons Votes and
  Proceedings, and the Standing Orders of the House of Commons can be
  downloaded.
</p>
