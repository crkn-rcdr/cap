<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>
  Since 1944 Numeris* has collected radio and television audience data through
  several methodologies in numerous markets across Canada, providing its members
  with invaluable insights into Canadians&rsquo; viewing and listening habits.
  Whether they&rsquo;re broadcasters, agencies, advertisers or other interested
  organizations, they need to know who is viewing or listening to what, and how
  many people are viewing or listening.
</p>

<p>
  Reports with audience data for the measured markets, compiled into a set of
  books for each survey conducted between 1944 and mid-2009, were originally
  available strictly to Numeris members. This historical material is now
  accessible to the public through these archives. Numeris plans to include
  material from mid-2009 in the future.
</p>

<h3 id="diarysurveybooks">Diary Survey Books</h3>

<p>
  From 1944 to mid-2009, audience data collected through surveys was processed
  and the results printed in reports included in a set of books (e.g. the Fall
  1982 television books), from which particular books were then distributed to
  Numeris&rsquo;s members according to their markets of interest. A typical set
  of survey books, either for radio or television, includes reports on every
  surveyed market, with some markets reported in individual
  <em>Market books</em> (e.g. a &ldquo;Toronto&rdquo; television book), or
  multiple markets compiled in <em>Regional books</em> (e.g. an
  &ldquo;Atlantic&rdquo; radio book containing Halifax, St. John&rsquo;s,
  Moncton, among other markets). A set of books also includes
  <em>Reach reports</em>, <em>Special reports</em> requested by members, and
  <em>Reference Material</em> pertaining to the survey.
</p>

<h3 id="surveyfrequencymarketsmeasuredandbookformatvariations">
  Survey Frequency, Markets Measured and Book Format Variations
</h3>

<p>
  The number of surveys conducted in a year has varied over time, starting with
  one radio survey in 1944 every two years, with frequency increasing to twice a
  year in 1956, which also included the introduction of the television service.
  Survey frequency increased to four times a year in 1963, with a variation in
  frequency thereafter. The Fall survey has typically been the major survey with
  all measured markets included, followed by the Spring survey. Winter and
  Summer surveys, when present, have typically included only major markets, as
  well as special surveys for some of those markets. Other special surveys may
  have been conducted in a year at the request of particular members, with
  results compiled and provided to those members.
</p>

<p>
  Markets measured from one year to another for the same type of survey (e.g.
  Fall survey) may also vary, although not considerably.
</p>

<p>
  The number of books printed for a survey, as well as the distribution of
  markets among books (i.e. markets included in individual Market books and
  markets in Regional books), varied over time due to different factors. For
  example, changes to the report content and/or format, such as the addition of
  demographic groups or type of audience estimates to the reports, resulted in
  larger reports that had to be split in separate books (e.g. a Regional book
  split into Market books and/or smaller Regional books). The number of books
  (and markets included in a book) among surveys within a year also varied,
  depending on the survey; a Fall survey typically includes all measured
  markets, while a Summer survey only major markets.

<h2 id="diarysurveys">Diary Surveys</h2>

<p>
  One of the methodologies Numeris has employed consists of collecting radio
  listening or TV viewing data through diaries. Diaries are essentially weekly
  surveys that capture the radio listening or TV viewing habits of individuals
  living in randomly selected households across various Canadian markets.
</p>

<p>
  Diary surveys are identified in the collection by the year and the closest
  season&rsquo;s name in which they were conducted (e.g. Fall 1970). Additional
  surveys in a year, either conducted for major markets only, or at the request
  of a particular member, are identified in the collection by the closest
  season&rsquo;s name and year, and a prefix such as &ldquo;pre&rdquo; or
  &ldquo;post&rdquo; (meaning before or after the main survey, not necessarily
  the season dates in a calendar year), or a similar identifier (e.g.
  &ldquo;special&rdquo;), to differentiate them from the main surveys (e.g.
  &ldquo;Pre Fall 1975&rdquo;).

<div id="radioCollection"></div>

<h2 id="radiocollection">Radio Collection</h2>

<p>
  The Radio collection contains material related to the radio measurement. The
  Radio collection is comprised primarily of Market Reports and Regional Reports
  (also referred to as Market or Regional books). The collection also contains
  Reach Reports and Special Reports, outlined below.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Note</strong>: Radio stations are identified in the collection by the
  call letter used by the C.R.T.C. An AM radio station&rsquo;s call letters is
  4-character long (e.g. CAAA); a few 3-character exceptions exist. A FM radio
  station&rsquo;s call letter has a 4-character base (a few 3-character
  exceptions may exist), followed by either &ldquo;FM&rdquo; or
  &ldquo;-FM&rdquo; depending on the type of report, report section or year.
  These variations should be considered when searching call letters in the
  collection.
</p>

<h3 id="radiomarketandregionalreports">Radio Market and Regional Reports</h3>

<p>
  The Radio Market and Regional Reports contain audience estimates on radio
  listening for each member station in a measured market. Information on a
  market may be included in a Market Report (e.g. a Toronto Market Report), or
  together with other markets within the same region in a Regional Report (e.g.
  the Halifax market in the Atlantic Regional Report). For a graphical summary
  of the evolution of the Radio Market and Regional Reports, see figure
  <strong>Radio Market and Regional Reports Through the Years</strong> below.
</p>

  or a Regional Report is a collection of reports related to the market(s).
