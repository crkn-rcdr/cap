<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>

<p>The search tool lets you do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Search documents by the <strong>document title</strong>,
    <strong>subject</strong> keywords, or their <strong>text</strong> content.
  </li>
  <li>Modify or refine search results in a number of ways.</li>
  <li>Open a document and browse its content.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The <strong>Start Screen</strong>, in Figure 1 below, lets you start a search
  by entering information in any of the areas on the right. In these areas you
  can do the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Type text to be searched in the <strong>SEARCH box</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Indicate where the text will be searched in a document. There are two
      options:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong><em>SIMPLE SEARCH</em></strong
          >: From the <strong>&lsquo;Search in&rsquo; drop-down list</strong>,
          select an area in the documents (i.e. Everything, Titles, Subjects or
          Text) where all the terms in the SEARCH box will be searched.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong><em>ADVANCED SEARCH</em></strong
          >: Add the prefix <em>ti:</em>, <em>su:</em> or <em>tx:</em> to a term
          in the <strong>SEARCH box</strong> to request that the term be
          searched in the title, subject or text, respectively. You may add
          different prefixes to different terms (e.g.
          <em>ti:television su:Halifax</em> will search the term "television" on
          titles and the term "Halifax" on subjects). More about prefixes below.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Narrow the search to a year range (<strong>Date Range boxes</strong>).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The <strong>Results Screen</strong>, in Figure 2 below, allows you to view the
  results list, open a document, modify or refine the results of a search, or
  start a new search, as explained in the examples below.
</p>

<p>
  The <strong>Viewer Screen</strong>, in Figure 4 below, allows you to view a
  document, browse its pages and search its text content, as explained below.

<h4 id="example2ndashmodifyasearchtorefineresults">
  Example 2 &ndash; Modify a Search to Refine Results
</h4>

<p>
  Starting with the results of the first search pictured above (Figure 2), which
  lists the documents that contain the term "M.A.S.H." (anywhere in the
  document) for surveys between 1980 and 1989 (both years included), assume you
  want to find audience data of the final episode of the M.A.S.H. television
  series. After a quick online search, you find it was broadcast on February 28,
  1983. In the form, modify the Date Range to <code>1983</code> in both boxes,
  and modify the SEARCH box to contain <code>"M.A.S.H." Toronto</code>, and
  click Update.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> When the Update button is clicked, a new search is
  executed according to the SEARCH box content and other filters. If you delete
  <code>"M.A.S.H."</code> and add <code>Toronto</code>, all documents with the
  word "Toronto" in their content will be found (i.e. "M.A.S.H." was no longer a
  search term).
</p>

<p>
  After browsing the results (Figure 2), you notice books for other markets,
  such as Brandon and Vancouver, not only Toronto. This is because the word
  "Toronto" appears as part of the address of Numeris&rsquo;s Head Office on the
  back cover of all the books printed in 1983. To eliminate other markets,
  modify the search text to contain <code>"M.A.S.H." su:Toronto</code> and click
  Update. Adding the prefix "su:" restricts the search of term "Toronto" to the
  Subject field (see note below regarding markets in subjects vs. titles). Some
  results are pictured in Figure 3 below.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> The collection includes Regional and Market books.
  Regional books, such as an Ontario book, were structured to contain reports on
  a number of markets not listed in their title. The Subject field has been
  structured to contain, among other pieces of information, the list of markets.
  Both Title and subject fields of individual Market books, such as a Toronto
  book, contain the market. In the current example, restricting the search to
  either <code>ti:Toronto</code> or <code>su:Toronto</code> retrieves the same
  Market books for the year 1983, when individual books were printed. As a
  general rule, when searching books related to a particular market, searching
  the subject may yield more accurate results. For markets or areas that may be
  too small to be included as a market, searching the text content may be the
  best approach.

</p>

<p>
  From the results, notice that there are books for different surveys in 1983:
  Spring, Summer, Winter and Fall. To find out whether February 28, the final
  episode of the series, was included in one of the surveys, you can do any of
  the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Open a title to see the dates on the cover (note that some books may not
    have dates on the cover, but inside the book).
  </li>
  <li>
    Display information on the document by clicking the Information button (+)
    to the right of the title, and look at the dates in the Notes/Description
    field.
  </li>
  <li>
    Look up the survey dates in the section
    <a href="/collection-info#diarySurveys">Diary Surveys</a> to be certain.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  You find out the date was included in the Spring survey, so you click on the
  title link to open the book and search through the pages.

</h4>

<p>
  Figure 4 below shows the open television book for the markets Toronto and
  Hamilton from the 1983 Spring survey in the <strong>Viewer Screen</strong>.
  From the previous example on Figure 3 above, we see that this book was one of
  the results of searching <code>"M.A.S.H." su:Toronto</code>, for documents
  related to surveys from 1983; therefore, the pages listed contains the term
  "M.A.S.H.".
</p>

<p>In the Viewer you can do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go back to search results.</li>
  <li>Search text within the document (Search box/Search button).</li>
  <li>
    Go to a page where the text on the Search box is found by clicking an image
    link (below the Search box).
  </li>
  <li>
    Switch between the document view and information view by clicking the View
    Tab and About Tab (below the document title).
  </li>
  <li>
    Go to a page by selecting the "image" from the drop-down list on the left of
    the Tools Bar located above the document image.
  </li>
  <li>Navigate to the first/next/previous/last page (Tools Bar).</li>
  <li>Rotate a page (Tools Bar).</li>
  <li>Zoom a page (Tools Bar).</li>
  <li>Download the document (Tools Bar).</li>

<p>
  Continuing with the example, you can locate the audience for the "M.A.S.H."
  finale in the Program section of the book (Image 50).
</p>

<p>
  While the book is open, you look for information on the show "Diff&rsquo;rent
  Strokes" (actual title spelling) in March 19, 1983 (date covered by the same
  Spring survey), when US First Lady Nancy Reagan made a special appearance on
  the show, according to online sources. You may not know how the program title
  was printed in the book. You try different searches, such as
  <code>"diff'rent strokes"</code>, <code>"different strokes"</code> or
  <code>diff*nt strok*</code>. The first two approaches search for the exact
  phase in the document. The last approach, which includes the "*" wildcard,
  searches for both partially matched terms
  <em>occurring in the same page when searching within a book</em> (see Example
  4 below for more details). This matches titles such as "different strokes",
  "different stroke", "diff&rsquo;rent strokes" and "diff&rsquo;rent stroke". In
  this particular book, the program was printed as "DIFFERENT STROKE" (without
  ending "S"); however, some books for other years have the title as
  "DIFF&rsquo;RENT STROKE".

<div id="sExample4"></div>

<h4 id="example4ndashsearchtwoormoretermsintextcontent">
  Example 4 &ndash; Search Two or More Terms in Text Content
</h4>

<p>
  There is a caveat when searching two or more terms in the text content of
  books, depending on whether you search in the Start/Results Screen or in the
  Viewer screen (an open book). Below is a quick summary of the differences,
  followed by an example.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>In the Start or Results screen:</strong> A search of two or more
      terms separated by spaces (the "and" operator) finds all the books where
      both terms are found in any of the pages, not necessarily within the same
      page. However, only pages where both terms are found within the page are
      listed under the title. When a book is found where the terms don&rsquo;t
      appear in the same page, a "No matching pages found" label is displayed
      instead of a page list under the title.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>In the Viewer screen (open book):</strong> A search of two or more
      terms separated by spaces (the "and" operator) in the Viewer finds all the
      pages where both terms are found within the page. These pages are listed
      under the title. To look for either of the words within the book, the "|"
      operator (the "or" operator) must be included between the terms.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>Example</strong> <br />
  You want to start a search for books with the TV show "Diff&rsquo;rent
  Strokes". You may not know how the program title was printed in the book, so
  you try <code>diff*nt strok*</code>, which will search for both terms
  partially matched by the wildcard. Figure 5 below shows the results.
</p>

<p>
  <img

    alt="Figure 5"
    id="figure5"
  />
  <br />
  <strong>Figure 5.</strong> Results of searching two terms.
</p>

<p>
  After sorting by "oldest", you notice two things in the results. First, titles
  from 1971, when the show started in 1978. And second, "No matching pages
  found" under some titles. As explained above, the books found contain both
  terms, although not necessarily in the same page. The books with "No matching
  pages found" are the books with no instances of both terms in the same page
  (i.e., the terms appear in different pages). You open the North Bay book, by
  example, and adjust the search text to <code>diff*nt | strok*</code> (with the
  "or" operator) to obtain the list of pages where one or the other term is
  matched, as pictured in Figure 6 below. A closer inspection of the pages found
  (pages not shown) reveals several instances of the word "different" in the
  introductory text and one instance of "stroke" as a program title.

>
  Example 5 &ndash; Use of Knowledge of Document Content and Metadata Structure
  to Guide a Search
</h4>

<p>
  Depending on the information you want to find, you may use different
  approaches to guide your search. For example, rather than simply entering a
  radio call letter into the SEARCH box, narrowing the search based on other
  known information may be a better approach. Useful information includes the
  type of content in different reports available and the call letter used in the
  reports to identify the station. Be aware:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Call letters can change over time</li>
  <li>
    The same call letters can be used by different stations at different times
  </li>
  <li>
    Numeris uses the same call letters as the C.R.T.C. to identify radio
    stations and television local (conventional) stations in reports
  </li>
  <li>Numeris may create short forms for certain call letters</li>
</ul>

<p>
  As an example of narrowing results, assume you want to know the morning
  audience of radio station CAAA (not a real call letter) in Edmonton in the
  fall of 1995. You know that audience at particular times of the day (time
  blocks) may be found in the <em>station report section</em> of a Radio Market
  book. After you enter
  <code>su:radio su:Edmonton su:market su:fall su:1995</code> in the SEARCH box
  (i.e. each term as part of the Subject field), you locate the Edmonton Radio
  Market book for Fall 1995. You open the book and search for the call letter,
  either by entering the call letter in the SEARCH box or by scrolling through
  the pages to find the <em>station report section</em>.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> Scroll through the pages as you would with a paper book
  when unsure about findings; do not rely on text search only. Optical character
  recognition, or OCR, is not 100% accurate, and may not correctly identify
  every instance of a call letter.

  Tips in this section focus on how text entered in the SEARCH box is handled by
  the search tool, and are not specific to the collection. For search tips
  specific to the collection, see
  <a href="#collectionSpecificTips">Collection-Specific Search Tips</a> below.
</p>

<p>
  The search form is a simple tool that lets you search by
  <strong>title</strong>, <strong>subject</strong> keywords, or the
  <strong>text</strong> content documents. The following features can be used
  within the SEARCH box to search or refine the results:
</p>

<h4 id="searchtermsarenotcaseoraccent-sensitive">
  Search terms are not case or accent-sensitive
</h4>

<p>
  For example, "Montr&eacute;al" and "montreal" will produce the same result.
  However, the prefixes <em>ti:</em> and <em>su:</em> (see below) must be in
  lower case.
</p>

<h4 id="wildcards:and">Wildcards: ? and *</h4>

<p>
  Use <strong><em>?</em></strong> in the middle or at the end of a word to match
  any one character. Use <strong><em>*</em></strong> to match any number of
  characters (including zero).
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Example: to find either <strong><em>catherine</em></strong> or
    <strong><em>catharine</em></strong
    >: <code>cath?rine</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Example: to find either <strong><em>labour</em></strong> or
    <strong><em>labor</em></strong
    >: <code>labo*r</code>
  </li>
  <li>Not allowed inside a phrase (i.e. inside double quotes).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="phrases:">Phrases: ""</h4>

<p>To search for an exact phrase, enclose all of the words in double quotes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Example: to find documents that contain the phrase
    <strong><em>montreal anglophone</em></strong> and not just the individual
    terms <strong><em>montreal</em></strong> and
    <strong><em>anglophone</em></strong
    >: <code>"montreal anglophone"</code>
  </li>
  <li>You cannot use wildcards within a phrase.</li>
  <li>Characters such as , . - / are ignored.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="alltermsandoperator:space">All terms ("and" operator): space</h4>

<p>To match all the terms, separate them by spaces.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Example: to find <strong><em>toronto</em></strong> and
    <strong><em>hamilton</em></strong> : <code>toronto Hamilton</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    See below regarding searching 2 or more terms in the Start/Result screen vs.
    in the Viewer.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="alternatetermsoroperator:">Alternate terms ("or" operator): |</h4>

<p>
  To match any one of a number of alternative terms, put a
  <strong>|</strong> between them.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Example: to find <strong><em>ottawa</em></strong> and either
    <strong><em>hull</em></strong> or <strong><em>gatineau</em></strong> :
    <code>ottawa hull | gatineau</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="excludedterms:-">Excluded terms: -</h4>

<p>
  Use the character " - " in front of a word or phrase to indicate that the term
  must not appear in the record.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Example, to find documents that have <strong><em>radio</em></strong> and
    <strong><em>reach</em></strong> in the title but not
    <strong><em>county</em></strong> (see below about prefix <em>ti:</em>):
    <code>ti:radio ti:reach -ti:county</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="fieldsearch:ti:su:">Field search: ti:, su:</h4>

<p>
  Use <strong><em>ti:</em></strong> or <strong><em>su:</em></strong> in front of
  a word or phrase to search only document titles or document subjects.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Unlike text searched, prefixes are case sensitive. Use lower case only.
  </li>
  <li>
    Example: to find documents that contain <strong><em>Toronto</em></strong> in
    the title: <code>ti:Toronto</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Example: to find documents that contain <strong><em>Barrie</em></strong> in
    the subject: <code>su:Barrie</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Example: to find documents that contain
    <strong><em>television</em></strong> and <strong><em>reach</em></strong> in
    the title: <code>ti:television ti:reach</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="searchingtwoormoretermswiththeandoperatorspace">
  Searching two or more terms with the "and" operator (space)
</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>In the Start or Results screen:</strong> A search of two or more
      terms separated by spaces (the "and" operator) in the Start/Results Screen
      will find all the documents where both terms are found in any of the
      pages, not necessarily within the same page. However, only pages where
      both terms are found within the page are listed under the title. When a
      document is found where the terms don&rsquo;t appear in the same page, a
      "No matching pages found" label is displayed instead of a page list under
      the title.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>In the Viewer (open document):</strong> A search of two or more
      terms separated by a spaces (the "and" operator) in the Viewer will find
      all the pages where both terms are found within the page. These pages are
      listed under the title. To look for either of the terms within the
      document, use the "|" operator between the terms.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="collection-specificsearchtips">Collection-Specific Search Tips</h3>

<p>
  This section presents simple tips to help locate a variety of content in the
  collection based on collection features, such as type of material (e.g. Reach
  Report), material content and metadata structure (e.g. information included in
  Subject field.
</p>

<p>
  As mentioned in other sections, the search tool lets you search by
  <strong>document title</strong>, <strong>subject</strong> keywords, or the
  <strong>text</strong> content of documents.
</p>

<p>
  The Subject field is structured to contain the following information: media,
  report type, survey name and year, and markets; for more information, see
  section <a href="#searchableInformation">Searchable Information</a> above.
</p>

<h4 id="radioandtelevision">Radio and Television</h4>

<h5 id="tip1:restrictsearchtotheradioortelevisioncollection">
  Tip # 1: Restrict search to the Radio or Television collection
</h5>

<p>
  Search the media in the Subject field with the "su:" prefix. Example:
  <code>su:television</code> or <code>su:radio</code>.
</p>

<h5 id="tip2:locatedocumentsrelatedtoaspecificmarket">
  Tip # 2: Locate documents related to a specific market
</h5>

<p>
  To locate Market or Regional Reports related to a market, search the market in
  the Subject field**. Market search by subject provides better results than
  searching for a market as part of the title. You may specify the report type,
  which is also included in the Subject field. Example:
  <code>su:moncton su:"market report"</code>.
</p>

<p>
  To locate Reach Reports that include a market, search the market in the text
  content and restrict the report type in the subject. Example:
  <code>moncton su:reach</code>. Reach Reports do not list the markets in the
  Subject field.
</p>

<p>
  Small areas not considered markets, and therefore not included in the Subject
  field, may be found by searching the text content.
</p>

<p>
  <small>
    ** Currently, Regional Reports do not list the related markets in the
    Subject field. The field will be updated with the market list in the future.
  </small>
</p>

<h5 id="tip3:locatedocumentsrelatedtoaspecificsurveyandyear">
  Tip # 3: Locate documents related to a specific survey and year
</h5>

<p>
  Search the survey name and year in the Subject field separately with the "su:"
  prefix. Example: <code>su:fall su:1981</code>. Alternately, you may enter the
  year in the Date Range boxes.
</p>

<h5 id="tip4:findacallletter">Tip # 4: Find a call letter</h5>

<p>
  Rather than simply entering a call letter into the SEARCH box, narrowing the
  search based on other known information may be a better approach. Helpful
  information includes the type of content of the different reports available
  (e.g. <code>su:market</code> for Market or Regional Reports) and the call
  letter used in the reports to identify the station. Be aware:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Call letters can change over time</li>
  <li>
    The same call letters can be used by different stations at different times
  </li>
  <li>
    Numeris uses the same call letters as the C.R.T.C. to identify radio
    stations and television local (conventional) stations in reports
  </li>
  <li>Numeris may create short forms for certain call letters</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Scroll through the pages as you would with a paper book when unsure about
  findings; do not rely on text search only. Optical character recognition, or
  OCR, is not 100% accurate, and may not correctly identify every instance of a
  call letter.
</p>

<h4 id="television">Television</h4>

<h5 id="tip5:searchatelevisionprogramtitle">
  Tip #5: Search a television program title
</h5>

<p>
  Program titles may be abbreviated due to space limitations. You may try using
  the "*" wildcard. Keep in mind that wildcards do not work within a phrase
  (double-quotes).
</p>

<p>
  Titles can be abbreviated a number of ways. If you are not successful locating
  a title, try scrolling through the program section of a report looking for the
  title.
