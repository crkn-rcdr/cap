<h3>Statement on problematic content and descriptions in Canadiana</h3>
<p>
  The Canadiana Collections contain content created over five centuries that
  tell an incomplete, oftentimes distorted and, sometimes harmful, story of
  Canada. The content, metadata, and resource descriptions in the Canadiana
  Collections contain language that reflects the biases, norms, and perspectives
  of the time in which they were created. This includes harmful and offensive
  wording, cultural references, and stereotypes. In order to accurately reflect
  the attitudes and viewpoints of the time in which these historical records
  were created, objects in the Canadiana collections are unchanged. In
  recognition of the harmful or painful impact of language and images, CRKN
  staff are actively committed to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    support and actively participate in efforts to update and change
    international standards for descriptions to ensure that descriptions are
    inclusive, respectful, and do not cause harm
  </li>
  <li>
    replace inappropriate language in the metadata and resource descriptions
    introduced during legacy cataloguing practices
  </li>
</ul>
<p>This is an ongoing process.</p>

  should review, please fill out our
