  These are the terms of service governing the use of the Canadiana website.
  CRKN reserves the right to update these terms of service from time to time.
</p>

<h3 id="useofthesite">Use of the Site</h3>

<p>
  Users agree to limit their use of the site to reasonable personal use (for any
  purpose, including research, teaching and professional). In particular, users
  agree not to systematically download, mirror, make available to third parties,
  or otherwise replicate substantial portions of these collections.
</p>

<p>
  Any other use of the site or its content requires written permission from
  CRKN. CRKN reserves the right to impose limits on an individual's use of the
  site in order to maintain overall quality of service. This includes but is not
  limited to restricting the number of concurrent downloads from any one
  individual. CRKN also retains the right to restrict, suspend or terminate
  users for behaviour that is abusive, illegal, or which unduly impairs access
  for other users.
</p>

<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>

<p>
  CRKN logs information about use of the site. This information may be shared in
  aggregate with third parties, but personally identifiable information will not
  be disclosed except as required by law.
</p>

<p>
  In order to obtain a Canadiana user account, a valid e-mail address must be
  provided. CRKN will not share email addresses or account information with
  third parties, except as required by law. CRKN will not send unsolicited email
  to email addresses provided by the user, except for notices directly relating
  to account and subscription status and related matters.
</p>

<p>
  Appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure the security, integrity and
  privacy of personally-identifiable information.
</p>

<h3 id="subscriptions">Subscriptions</h3>

<p>
  Subscriptions to Canadiana collections are for the personal use of one
  individual or household. Subscribers must not distribute their Canadiana
  account credentials and must take reasonable care to ensure that their
  password remains secure.
</p>

<p>
  Subscribers may access all of a collection&rsquo;s content and features for
  the duration of their subscription, and may download copies of material in the
  collection. They may also continue to access and use previously-downloaded
  materials (PDF documents) after their subscription terminates; however, lost
  or destroyed copies cannot be re-downloaded outside of the subscription
  period. It is the responsibility of the subscriber to ensure proper storage
  and backup of any content downloaded from the site.
</p>

<p>
  Users who are not subscribers to a collection may have limited access to its
  content and features. Subscribers to a collection and users accessing the
  collection from a location covered by an institutional site license will have
  access to all its content and features; however, access to certain features
  may require a valid Canadiana user account.
</p>

<h3 id="copyright">Copyright</h3>

<p>
  CRKN holds copyright to its collections as a whole. Substantial portions of
  these collections may not be reproduced or distributed without its express
  permission. While many of the documents, photographs and other works or
  subject matter available on this site are in the public domain, this may not
  always be the case. All users of the site are responsible to ascertain for
  themselves whether any particular work or other subject matter is protected by
  copyright and to seek any necessary permission from the copyright owner(s) if
  they intend to use any such material.
