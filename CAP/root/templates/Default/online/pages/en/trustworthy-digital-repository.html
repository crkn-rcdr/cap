<p>
  The Canadiana <strong>Trustworthy Digital Repository</strong> (TDR) is a
  reliable and integrated digital preservation system in which deposited content
  can be identified, collected, managed, and kept secure over time. The TDR
  provides a permanent capability to preserve the documentary heritage digitized
  through CRKN projects, as well as content already digitized or born-digital,
  and content received from project partners.

<h3 id="preservationcommittments">Preservation Committments</h3>

<p>
  CRKN is committed to providing members and stakeholders with enduring access
  to its own collections and to the long-term preservation of all of the images
  and metadata of which they are comprised. This includes ensuring that content
  continues to be accessible as file formats, application platforms and other
  technologies evolve over time, while ensuring the integrity of the original
  digital formats.
</p>

<p>
  For material deposited in the TDR by a partner, CRKN is committed to the
  long-term preservation of that content, including all accompanying metadata,
  in the same format provided, such that the client can always be assured of
  being able to retrieve exactly what was deposited. CRKN commits to applying
  the same standards and practices for ensuring long-term preservation and
  access as it does for its own content, and to providing online access in a
  manner consistent with the client&rsquo;s requirements.

<p>
  CRKN, through the Canadiana TDR, preserves only digital information. It
  accepts digital material directly, but also provides digitization services if
  necessary. Paper or other non-digital originals are returned to source.
  Metadata describing the data and creating access points to it is also
  preserved. CRKN, through the Canadiana platform, delivers online access to the
  content by providing general portals as well as provider-specific portals.
  User access eligibility is defined by the provider of the content.
