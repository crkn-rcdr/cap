  This document describes
  <strong>Canadiana&rsquo;s Preservation Policy and Strategy</strong>,
  including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    What content is accepted for preservation in the
    <a href="/trustworthy-digital-repository">Trustworthy Digital Repository</a>
  </li>
  <li>The nature of preservation activities</li>
  <li>How access to preserved content is facilitated</li>
  <li>
    Strategies employed to ensure the ongoing preservation of, and access to,
    preserved content
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="preservedcontent">Preserved Content</h3>

<p>
  Canadiana preserves only digital content and information. Canadiana accepts
  digital content and metadata for ingest and preservation. Canadiana will also
  accept analog materials, in which case it will create digital surrogates which
  it will ingest and preserve. The original analog materials are returned to
  their owners. Canadiana makes no claims or assumptions about the continuing
  preservation or availability of these analog sources. Metadata ingested with
  the digital content is also preserved, whether supplied by the depositor or
  created by Canadiana.
</p>

<p>
  Canadiana produces, preserves and hosts its own digital content. The original
  source material is obtained from multiple sources, but the digitized versions
  belong to Canadiana and are preserved and hosted as part of Canadiana&rsquo;s
  own collections.
</p>

<p>
  Canadiana also preserves and hosts digital content belonging to third party
  depositors. Depositors may supply Canadiana with the digitized content or may
  engage the services of Canadiana to digitize analog material. A depositor
  agreement between Canadiana and the depositor is required prior to ingest of
  any content.
</p>

<p>
  Not all content digitized by Canadiana for third parties is ingested or
  preserved. From time to time, Canadiana will digitize material for a client
  and return copies of the digitized content to the client without retaining or
  preserving a copy itself. Such arrangements do not require a depositor
  agreement.
</p>

<p>
  Content belonging to Canadiana is preserved indefinitely. Content belonging to
  third party depositors is preserved in accordance with their respective
  depositor agreements.
</p>

<h3 id="preservationcommitment">Preservation Commitment</h3>

<p>
  Content is ingested into the Canadiana repository in the form of a SIP.
  Canadiana preserves the SIP in its original form and guarantees the ability of
  the depositor to extract an identical SIP from the repository at any point in
  the future. Any revisions or migrations of SIPs are also preserved such that a
  depositor can access each revision or migration as well as the original.
  Previous revisions of SIPs may contain standards or formats no longer
  supported by Canadiana&rsquo;s access tools. This means that, while older
  revisions are preserved and can be retrieved, Canadiana may not maintain the
  tools needed to provide mediated access to those formats. Canadiana will
  migrate a SIP to currently-supported standards and formats before phasing out
  mediated access to any existing standards or formats within that SIP.
</p>

<p>
  From time to time, Canadiana may modify the standards and requirements for a
  valid SIP. All previously-ingested SIPs will continue to be supported, but any
  newly ingested SIPs must conform to the current requirements. This means that,
  within the repository, there may exist SIPs that were valid at the time of
  ingest and which remain supported by Canadiana, but which would not be
  ingestible under the the current specifications.
</p>

<h3 id="accesstocontent">Access to Content</h3>

<p>
  Canadiana makes preserved content, and/or derivatives thereof, available
  online through a series of online services. This content may be freely
  accessible to the public or restricted to subscribers or other authorized
  users. Content may also be held dark: preserved within the repository but
  inaccessible except by special request from the depositor.
</p>

<p>
  Content belonging to Canadiana is made available in accordance with
  Canadiana&rsquo;s collection policies and agreements with subscribers and
  stakeholders. Content belonging to a third party depository is made available
  in accordance with the depositor agreement between Canadiana and the
  depositor. Canadiana makes both the original deposited content as well as any
  revisions or migrations of that content available to the depositor under terms
  described in the depositor agreement.
</p>

<h3 id="riskstocontentpreservationandaccess">
  Risks to Content Preservation and Access
</h3>

<p>
  Long-term risks to the preservation of and access to digital content fall into
  three main categories:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Formats and Standards: inability to migrate or provide access to content and
    metadata due to obsolete or unsupported standards and formats.
  </li>
  <li>
    Preservation and Network Infrastructure: Loss or corruption of data due to
    errors, failures or intrusion into hardware or software.
  </li>
  <li>
    Succession Plan: Inability to maintain preservation and access
    infrastructure due to loss of financial viability.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="formatsandstandards">Formats and Standards</h3>

<p>
  Digital content and metadata must conform to the supported standards and
  formats described in Canadiana&rsquo;s
  <a href="http://www.canadiana.ca/schema/2012/mets/csip.xml"
    >METS application profile</a
  >. Canadiana may amend the list of supported standards from time to time.
  Canadiana will continue to preserve existing content within the repository
  even if it no longer accepts and/or facilitates access to new content of that
  type.
</p>

<p>
  Canadiana supports standards and formats which it has evaluated and determined
  that it can reliably support the ingest, preservation and access of that
  format. In particular, Canadiana must ensure that:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The format or standard is established, well-documented, and shows evidence
    of widespread and consistent implementation
  </li>
  <li>
    There are no proprietary licences or encumbrances which may restrict
    Canadiana&rsquo;s ability to store, manipulate or migrate data from the
    format or standard to another
  </li>
  <li>
    There is a viable forward migration path for the standard or format in the
    event that it becomes obsolete or unsupported
  </li>
  <li>
    There exist sufficient non-proprietary tools to manipulate, evaluate and
    provide access to the standard or format, and these tools are efficiently
    and effectively incorporated into Canadiana&rsquo;s preservation and access
    network
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Each supported format and standard is evaluated on an annual basis to
  determine whether they continue to meet these criteria. When Canadiana
  determines that a format or standard no longer meets these criteria, it will
  migrate any content or metadata in this format to an alternate format which
  does meet the criteria. Both the original and migrated content will be
  preserved, but access to the original content may be limited.
</p>

<h3 id="preservationnetworkandinfrastructure">
  Preservation Network and Infrastructure
</h3>

<p>
  Ensuring that content is not lost, corrupted or altered as a result of system
  error, hardware failure, user error or intrusion is achieved through a
  combination of server redundancy, limited access and regular fixity checking.
  Key aspects include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A minimum of 5 copies of each object (and all associated metadata) are
    preserved
  </li>
  <li>Copies are preserved in a minimum of four different physical sites.</li>
  <li>
    All files have their checksums computed at ingest time. Each copy of each
    file is validated against its checksum on a regular basis. Missing files,
    and files which do not match their originally computed checksums are
    reported automatically to the lead systems engineer. The standard validation
    period is one check of each copy of each file every 30 days.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hardware and software is designed to be fault-tolerant. Industry standard
    hardware and open source software are used to eliminate the risk of
    dependence on a particular vendor. Disk arrays are configured with built-in
    redundancy (RAID) to prevent data loss. In the event that data loss does
    occur, restoration can be done from one of the remaining copies.
  </li>
  <li>
    Access to repository servers is limited to IT staff who have a specific need
    to access those systems.
  </li>
  <li>
    Industry standard system and network security processes are observed,
    including intrusion detection, system logging and allowing remote login via
    encrypted (SSH) protocols only.
  </li>
  <li>
    One copy of the repository is kept offline at all times in order to prevent
    a remote intruder from being able to access all copies of the repository.
  </li>
  <li>
    All manipulations of the repository, including ingesting, modifying and
    updating Archival Information Packages (AIPs), are mediated by a software
    application which ensures all changes result in valid AIPs.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="successionplan">Succession Plan</h3>

<p>
  In the event that Canadiana becomes incapable of continuing operations, it has
  made arrangements to provide copies of the repository and all associated
  tools, software and systems to three institutions: University of Alberta,
  University of Toronto and Library and Archives Canada.
</p>

<p>
  Individual depositor agreements stipulate whether each individual
  depositor&rsquo;s content will be maintained and preserved by
  Canadiana&rsquo;s successors. Canadiana&rsquo;s successors have agreed to
  preserve all content in the repository (other than that which is excluded by
  depositor agreements) where no legal prohibitions to doing so exist.
</p>
