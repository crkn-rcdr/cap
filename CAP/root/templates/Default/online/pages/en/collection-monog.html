  Monographs is comprehensive, with titles selected and digitized from the
  holdings of more than 200 libraries. Between 2003 and 2016, Canadiana
  strengthened and updated this research collection by adding monograph titles
  identified and located by scholars as well as by titles recently acquired by
  major Canadian repositories. Onsite surveys of libraries, archives, and
  uncatalogued special collections have brought to light both rare and
  previously unknown imprints.
