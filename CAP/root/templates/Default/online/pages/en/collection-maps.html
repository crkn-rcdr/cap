<p>
  The Maps collection currently contains nearly 24,000 Canadian maps digitized from the 1:50,000 scale National Topographic Series. The maps date from 1905 to 2012 and cover all of the Canadian provinces and territories. These maps depict in detail ground relief (landforms and terrain), drainage (lakes and rivers), forest cover, administrative areas, populated areas, transportation routes and facilities (including roads and railways), and other human-made features such as buildings, power lines and dams. The collection includes both colour and grayscale maps.
</p>
<p>
  The maps were digitized by McGill University Library and are presented here as the result of a partnership between McGill University Library and the Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN). The Maps collection is the first large-scale addition of CRKN member content to the Canadiana collection.

<p>
  Portions of the 1:50,000 scale National Topographic Series Map Collection are also available through Scholars GeoPortal and Borealis, where maps have been georeferenced to create geospatial datasets for open use in research and historical analysis, with funding support from the University of Toronto Libraries, McGill University Libraries and Compute Ontario.
