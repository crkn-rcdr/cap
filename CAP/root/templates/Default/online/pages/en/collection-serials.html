  The Serials collection includes a wide range of dailies, weeklies, specialized
  journals and mass-market magazines, as well as city directories and annual
  reports from churches, schools, and corporations. Specialized publications
  include trade or industry journals in addition to popular magazines catering
  to various demographics: men, women, students, children, and diverse
  ethnolinguistic communities. Early periodicals are an invaluable source of
  information for researchers in all fields, as they offer a remarkable record
  of thought and opinion on diverse issues facing society. Lavishly-illustrated
  journals open a captivating window onto early Canadian society and culture
  through their articles, advertisements, cartoons, drawings and photographs.
