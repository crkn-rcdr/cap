    <h2>Catalogue</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Ce catalogue, dont le but consiste à décrire la collection Héritage, est encore un ouvrage en voie de réalisation puisqu’à peine un peu plus de 50 pourcent de la collection y est décrite jusqu’à présent. Les descriptions fournies ici donnent toutefois une idée assez juste de ce que sera la collection complète. Comme vous le remarquerez, chaque aspect de la société canadienne, depuis les premiers jours de la colonie jusqu’au milieu du XXe siècle, se reflète dans ces documents.</p>
    <p>Nous travaillons présentement à la description du reste du contenu et des mises à jour de ce catalogue seront publiées régulièrement.</p>
    <p>Nous ignorons à l’heure actuelle le nombre exact de titres qui composeront la collection – mais sa taille est estimée à 800 titres, soit 60 millions de  pages.</p>
    <div class="well">
        <h3>Quelques chiffres rapides</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Nombre de microfilms dans la collection complète : 35,000 +</li>
            <li>Nombre de microfilms décrits dans ce catalogue : 19,941</li>
            <li>Nombre estimatif de titres dans la collection complète : 800 +</li>
            <li>Nombre de titres décrits dans ce catalogue : 505</li>
            <li>Nombre de pages dans la collection complète : 60,000,000</li>
            <li>Nombre estimatif de pages décrites dans ce catalogue : 30,453,000</li>
            <li>Un peu plus de 50 pourcent de la collection est décrite dans ce catalogue.</li>
        </ul>

    <p><strong>Quelques points à retenir au moment d’utiliser ce catalogue :</strong></p>
    <p>Les descriptions trouvées dans ce catalogue proviennent en grande partie de la liste des fonds d’archives de Bibliothèque et Archives Canada (BAC) disponible en ligne – le catalogue MIKAN. Le numéro qui apparaît dans la colonne « No Mikan » correspond à un numéro attribué au document par BAC dans sa base de données MIKAN. Si vous allez sur la page de recherche de MIKAN intitulée <a href="http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/lac-bac/recherche/arch_elab">Recherche de fonds d’archives &mdash; Advancée</a> et que vous choisissez d’effectuer une recherche par « Numéro Mikan », en inscrivant le numéro indiqué dans la colonne « No Mikan » de ce catalogue, vous obtiendrez pour ce titre la description plus complète de BAC.</p>
    <p>Lorsque des dates sont fournies pour un titre spécifique (par ex., Canada. Dept. of Indian Affairs. Manitoba Regional Office. Central Registry Files, 1939-1981), veuillez garder à l’esprit que ces dates sont celles qui se rapportent à la collection sur papier conservée par BAC. Canadiana.org est, et demeurera toujours, respectueux des lois sur la vie privée et le droit d’auteur. Il ne lui sera donc pas toujours possible de numériser les dossiers plus récents qui se trouvent dans ces collections.</p>
    <p>L’exactitude de ce catalogue n’est peut-être pas garantie à 100 %. Il se peut que quelques titres listés ici ne soient pas disponibles dans la collection Héritage.  Dans l’ensemble, la collection Héritage ne devrait comprendre aucun titre déjà numérisé par BAC et accessible en ligne. Nous mettons tout en œuvre pour éliminer ces titres du présent catalogue, mais il peut arriver que de tels titres soient inclus par inadvertance dans cette liste. Lorsque ces titres seront portés à notre attention, ils seront supprimés.</p>

    <h2>Catalogue</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This catalogue, which aims to describe the Héritage collection, is still very much a work in progress with slightly more than 50% of the collection outlined so far. The collection, as outlined here, however, provides a representative snapshot of the complete collection. As you will notice, every facet of Canadian society, from the first days of settlement until the middle of the 20th century, is reflected in these documents.</p>
    <p>We are busy working on describing the remainder of the content and we will be releasing regular updates to this catalogue.</p>
    <p>At this point, we do not know exactly how many titles will make up the collection &mdash; however, the estimated size is 800 titles on 60 million pages.</p>
    <div class="well">
        <h3>Some quick statistics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>No. of films in complete collection: 35,000+</li>
            <li>No. of films described in this catalogue: 19,941</li>
            <li>Estimated no. of titles in complete collection: 800 +</li>
            <li>No. of titles described in this catalogue: 505</li>
            <li>No. of pages in complete collection: 60,000,000</li>
            <li>Estimated no. of pages described in this catalogue: 30,453,000</li>
            <li>Just over 50% of the collection has been described in this catalogue.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p><strong>A few things to be mindful of when using this catalogue:</strong></p>
    <p>Descriptions in this catalogue have largely been taken from Library and Archive Canada's (LAC) online listing of archival holdings &mdash; the MIKAN catalogue. The number that appears in the column "Mikan no." refers to a number that LAC has assigned to the document in its MIKAN database. If you go to the <a href="http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/lac-bac/search/arch_adv">MIKAN search page</a> and choose to search by "MIKAN number", entering the number from the "Mikan no" column in this catalogue, will bring up LAC’s more complete descriptive record for that title.</p>
    <p>Where dates are provided for an individual title (e.g. <i>Canada. Dept. of Indian Affairs. Manitoba Regional Office. Central Registry Files, 1939-1981</i>), please keep in mind that these are the dates given for the paper collection as it exists at LAC. Canadiana.org is, and will continue to be, respectful of privacy and copyright laws and will not always be able to digitize the more recent files in collections.</p>
    <p>The accuracy of this catalogue may not be 100%. There may be a few cases where, titles listed may end up not being part of the Héritage collection. For the most part, the Héritage collection will not include any titles that LAC has already digitized and hosted online. We are making every effort to keep such titles out of the catalogue, but there may be a few cases where these titles have inadvertently been included in this listing. Once they come to our attention, we will remove them.</p>

Minutes and Orders in Council are reports submitted to the Committee of the Privy Council which become orders in council when they are approved by the Governor General. There is little difference between an order and a minute of council, that difference is one of form rather than substance. The Orders in Council for the period 1867-1900 are available on microfilm reels C-3287 to C-3353, C-3371 to C-3427, C-3602 to C-3671, C-3769 to C-3785. [This is around 207 films.] Although the Orders in Council for the period 1901-1952 are also available on microfilm reels T-4442 to T-5245, [around 803 films] the film is not only of poor quality, but it was not filmed according to archival standards. For example, there are no targets, no running heads and some of the 35mm film has two parallel 16mm exposures on the same film making it hard to read.)</td>
