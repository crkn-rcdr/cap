  The H&eacute;ritage project will digitize and make available some of
  Canada&rsquo;s most popular archival collections encompassing approximately 60
  million pages of primary-source documents. Chronicling the country and its
  people from the 1600s to the mid-1900s, this collection represents a vast and
  unique resource for Canadian historians, students, and genealogists.

<h3 id="anessentialresource">An Essential Resource</h3>

<p>
  H&eacute;ritage consists of a wide variety of unique records now being
  digitized from the treasured holdings of Library and Archives Canada. The end
  result will be a significant corpus of documentary heritage spanning three
  centuries. For ease of navigation, the collection has been divided into five
  core subject areas:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    An impressive array of genealogy materials, including immigration records,
    church records, land records, family histories and papers, voters&rsquo;
    lists, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    A large volume of documents relating to Canada&rsquo;s aboriginal peoples
    &ndash; First Nations, M&eacute;tis and Inuit
  </li>
  <li>
    Key early documents from core government departments, including Indian
    Affairs, Immigration, Health, Agriculture, Railways and Canals, Fisheries
    and Natural Resources
  </li>
  <li>
    A rich military history component documenting Canada&rsquo;s participation
    in several wars, (War of 1812, First World War, World War II), as well as
    the administration of the military during times of peace
  </li>
  <li>
    Papers from prominent Canadians, such as Prime Ministers, Governors General,
    premiers, cabinet ministers, explorers, scientists, entrepreneurs, writers
    and artists
  </li>
</ul>

  reflects your research interest. Each collection page includes basic finding

</p>

<p>
  The <a href="/">basic Search</a> can help guide you to a collection which
  matches your chosen keywords. The Search is a simple form which scans
  collections for both descriptive information and metadata, such as title
  words, author/creator names, subjects, as well as the text content of
  documents, where available.
</p>

<h3 id="canisearchthefulltext">Can I search the full text?</h3>

<p>
  Very little archival text is currently visible to our search tools.
  Transcribing these records to produce the searchable text will take time and
  resources and is a major objective of the project. Future versions of
  H&eacute;ritage will support full-text searching of documents as they are
  transcribed, bringing out massive amounts of information fully integrated into
  the portal for search and discovery. Over the coming years, additional
  research tools and infrastructure for enhanced metadata creation and linking
  will be developed by Canadiana and its H&eacute;ritage partners.
