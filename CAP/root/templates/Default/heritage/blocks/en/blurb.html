<h2 id="heacuteritage">H&eacute;ritage</h2>

<p>
  The H&eacute;ritage project is a 10-year initiative to digitize and make
  accessible online some of Canada&rsquo;s most popular archival collections
  encompassing roughly 40 million pages of primary-source documents. Chronicling
  the country and its people from the 1600s to the mid-1900s, this collection
  represents a vast and unique resource for Canadian historians, students, and
  genealogists.
