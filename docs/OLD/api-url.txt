SYNOPSIS

Variables

$app
  Name of the application.

$iface
  Can be a supported ISO language code (en, fr, etc.) for a Web interface,
  or a supported API format (xml, json, etc.)

$key
  The unique key of the context object being searched or shown.

$type
  The object type to retrieve. Supported types include:

  pages: records with type page
  titles: records with type serial or monograph

$context
  The context in which the following element (the $key indicating the
  context object) is interpreted. Contexts include:

  parent: search results are limited to children of the context object (no
    grandchildren, etc.)
  group: search results are limited to records which have a group key
    matching the key of the context object.

$start
  The page of results to retrieve. If not specified, defaults to 1.

$query
  The query parameters to use. There are two types: search fields and
  other parameters. All search parameters are ANDed together. Blank fields
  (fields with no values) are ignored. Supported query parameters include:

  Search parameters (search for text within the field):
  ti: title field
  au: author
  su: subject

  so: Solr sort field. e.g. 'ti asc' to sort by title


URLs:

/portal/$app/$iface/show/$key[/$start]
    Show the requested item. $start makes sense in some contexts, e.g.: if
    $key refers to a serial, $start defines which page of issues to show.

/portal/$app/$iface/search/$type[/$start]?$query

/portal/$app/$iface/search/within/$context/$key/$type[/%start]?$query

/portal/$app/$iface/grouped/$type[/$start]?$query

/portal/$app/$iface/grouped/within/$context/$key/$type[/%start]?$query
