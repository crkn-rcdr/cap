Install MacPorts and install

shared-mime-info
netpbm

Download, build  and install the mime-info package from freedesktop.org.
The ports version doesn't put everything in the right place, but does give
you the tools you need to build. (MAYBE WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS - CAN
JUST INSTALL THE BUILD TOOLS FROM PORTS)
